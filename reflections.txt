Your response goes here!

* I learned how to use superscript, italic, strikethrough vs delete and the horizontal line.
* Most of this project was easy, once I understood what to do.
* So far the difficult thing for me are the links and images, so I am glad I got to practice that.
* On the lesson with the figure capture I had some trouble so I had to leave it and come back to it.
Once I thought about it with a clear mind I was able to get it.
